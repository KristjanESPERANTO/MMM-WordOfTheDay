# MMM-WordOfTheDay

**MMM-WordOfTheDay** is a module for [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror) to show the [Word of the Day from Merriam Webster's dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day).

This module does NOT require the user to enter any external API keys or secrets. The status of this project is a WIP nearing completion. It is a fairly simple module, but I am still working through some edge cases.

This module works best on one of the sides (`top_left`, `bottom_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_right`). I am hoping to develop capabilities for `top_bar`, `bottom_bar`, and other positions as I think that would be pretty cool, but that is a future problem. If you're a dev, feel free to make a pull request with this small fix!

Enjoy the module :)
